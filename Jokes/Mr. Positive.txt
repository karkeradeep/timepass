There was a guy named John, who was the most positive guy in the world. Every time someone said something negative, John would always say, "it could have been worse."
One day, John's co-workers all got together and decided to come up with a scenario so bad that John wouldn't be able to say that it could have been worse.

When John arrived at work that day, one of his co-workers asked him, "John did you hear what happened to Sam last night?"

John replied "No, what?"

The co-worker explained, "When Sam got home last night, he found his wife in bed with another man. Sam shot the man, his wife, and then turned the gun on himself."

John replied, "Well, it could have been worse."

In disgust the co-worker replied, "Now how could that have been any worse?"

John replied, "Because if it had been the night before he would have shot me."

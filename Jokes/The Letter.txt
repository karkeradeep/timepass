A nurse sees that her patient is busily occupied with something, so she walks up to him and asks, "Hey Steve, what are you doing?"
Steve replies, "I'm writing a letter."

Interested, the nurse asks him, "Who are you writing a letter to?"

Steve replies, "I'm writing a letter to myself."

The nurse is really curious now and asks, "What is the letter about?"

Stever replies "How should I know?!? I haven't received it yet!"

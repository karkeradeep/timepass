One Sunday after church service, a man walked up to the pastor and said, "Father, that was a damn fine service, damn fine." 
Father Robert replied, "I thank you, but would you mind not using that kind of language in the House of the Lord?"

The man continued, "I was so damn impressed with that service, that I put $5,000 in the collection plate."

So Father Robert exclaimed, "No sh*t!"

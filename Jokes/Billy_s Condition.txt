Billy is lying in a hospital bed after having his leg amputated.
The doctor enters his room and in a cool, hushed tone, says, "Billy, I have some good news and some bad news."

Billy says, "Hey Doc, my life is practically ruined after this accident, what worse news can I hear? Gimme the bad news first!"

The doctor says, "Billy, I'm sorry, but we cut off the wrong leg."

Billy is distraught. In a slow quivering voice he asks, "...and the good news?"

The doctor replies, "Your other leg is getting better!"

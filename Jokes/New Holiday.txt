Every 14th of February you get the chance to display your fondness for your wife or girlfriend by showering her with gifts, flowers, dinner, shows, and any other baubles that women find romantic. 
Here's a secret: Guys feel left out. That's right -- left out. There's no special holiday for the ladies to show their appreciation for the men in their lives. Men as a whole are either too proud or just too embarrassed to admit it. Which is why a new holiday has been created. 

March 20th is now officially "Steak & BJ Day." 

Simple, effective and self-explanatory, this holiday has been created so your ladies can have a day to show your man just how much you love him. No cards, no flowers, no special nights on the town. The name of the holiday explains it all; just a steak and a BJ. That's it. This twin pairing of Valentine's Day and Steak & BJ Day will usher in a new age of love as men everywhere will try that much harder in February to ensure a more memorable March! It's like a perpetual love machine. 

The word is already spreading, but as with any new idea, it needs a little push to start the ball rolling. So spread the word, and help bring love and peace to this crazy world.

A zoo had acquired a very rare species of gorilla. Within a few weeks, the gorilla -- a female -- became very horny and difficult to handle. Upon examination, the zoo veterinarian determined that the problem was the heat. What to do? There was no male of this species available. 
While reflecting on their problem, the zoo administrators noticed Mike, an employee responsible for cleaning the animals' cages. Now Mike, it was rumored, possessed ample ability to satisfy any female, and he wasn't very bright. So the zoo administrators thought they might have a solution. Perhaps they could entice Mike to satisfy the female gorilla. 

So he was approached with a proposition: Would he be willing to sleep with the gorilla for five hundred bucks? 

Mike replied that he might be interested, but would have to think the matter over. 

The following day, Mike announced that he would accept their offer, but only under three conditions: 

"First," he said, "I don't want to have to kiss her." 

"Second, I want nothing to do with any offspring that may result from this union." 

The zoo's administration quickly accepted to these conditions, but what was the third?

"Well," said Mike, "You've gotta give me another week to come up with the five hundred bucks."

Little Johnny returns from school and tells his father that he got an "F" in arithmetic that day. 
"Why?" asks his father. 

"The teacher asked, 'How much is 2 x 3?' And I said 6." 

"But that's right," said his father. 

"Then she asked me 'How much is 3 x 2?'." 

"What's the f***ing difference?" asks his father. 

"That's what I said!"

A priest was driving along and saw a nun on the side of the road. He stopped and offered her a lift, which she accepted.
She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to open and reveal a lovely leg. The priest had a look and nearly got into an accident.

After controlling the car, he stealthfully slid his hand up her leg. The nun looked at him and immediately said, "Father, remember Psalm 129?"

The priest was flustered and apologized profusely. He forced himself to remove his hand.

However, he was unable to remove his eyes from her leg. Further on, while switching gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. The nun repeated, "Father, remember Psalm 129?"

Once again the priest apologized. "Sorry sister, but the flesh is weak."

Arriving at the convent, the nun got out, gave him a meaningful glance and went on her way. On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to retrieve a bible and looked up Psalm 129.

It read: "Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory."

Moral of the story: Always be well-informed in your job, or you might miss a great opportunity!

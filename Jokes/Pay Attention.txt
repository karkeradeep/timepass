First-year students at medical school were receiving their first anatomy class with the body of a deceased man. They all gathered around the surgery table where lay the cadaver, covered with a white sheet.
The professor started the class by telling them, "In medicine, it is necessary to have two important qualities as a doctor. The first is that you must not be disgusted by anything involving the human body." To prove his point, the professor pulled back the sheet, stuck his finger in the butt of the corpse, withdrew it, and stuck it in his mouth. "Go ahead and do the same thing," he told his students.

The students freaked out, and after a few minutes of hesitation, took turns sticking a finger in the butt of the dead body and sucking on it.

When everyone finished, the professor looked at them and told them, "The second most important quality is observation. I stuck in my middle finger and sucked on my index finger. Now learn to pay attention!"
